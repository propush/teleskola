### Teleskola

Creates a video layer out of your telemetry data. It's very simple and rather fast.

To be run as:
```
java -jar teleskola.jar -c teleskola.json -i <path_to_telemetry_csv_file>
```

For now only opentx telemetry is supported.
ImageMagick (```convert[.exe]```) is required in your path in order to create video.
